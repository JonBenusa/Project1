		<h2> Puppers </h2>
		<p>
			My family got a covid puppy! His name is Koa. 
			He is always either trying to ge someone to play wiht him, running in circles when the zoomies hit, or when he crashes he is SUPER snuggly!
			(Plus I am definitly his favorite)

		<h2>SCSU Hockey</h2>
		<p>
			My favorite team to watch is are the St. Cloud D1 Hockey team. 
			As a kid I used to go watch them several times a season with my family.
			In recent years they've been consistently one of the top 10 teams, even favorites to win the NCAA tournament a couple of times.
			Unfortunately, in good old Minnesota fassion they always find a way to underperform in the playoffs and lose due to poor goaltending.

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>
			I love to listen to music! I am also a bit of an audiophile. 
			I love high end audio equipment and even have gathered a decent stereo system over the past couple years.
			It is always fun to hear how the songs take on slightly different qualities and what new small details come out when on one system vs another.
			I love all kinds of bands in all sorts of genres. Quinn XCII, AJR, Chris Stapleton, Imagine Dragons and Lead Zeplin all are some of my favorite bands.
